## Booking.com with Laravel

Re Creating Booking.com API with Laravel and PHPUnit.

- We will create a DB structure and API endpoints for managing properties, property search, showing apartments/rooms data, and making bookings.

- All of that is covered by automated tests with PHPUnit.

## Lesson - 1 

- Create our simple DB structure for roles/permissions
- Create first API endpoints and PHPUnit Tests for registration
- Simulate API endpoints for logged-in users and write tests to check permissions
- Alternative: look at the spatie/laravel-permission package

 # Simple Permissions with Gates

- Manage properties
- Make booking
- Change the user's password
- etc.
